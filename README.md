## 🌟 About TechTrove
TechTrove is my **living portfolio**, designed to grow alongside me.  
It’s more than a collection of repositories — it’s a **narrative of exploration**, covering everything from applied deep learning to system design, hackathons, and real-world problem solving.  

The motivation behind TechTrove came from my belief that a portfolio should not just **list projects**, but also **tell the story** of the challenges solved, the lessons learned, and the innovations pursued.
