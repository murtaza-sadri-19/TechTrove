# Development Guide

This guide covers the development workflow and best practices for TechTrove.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Firebase CLI
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone and Setup**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/murtaza-sadri-19/TechTrove.git
   cd TechTrove
   ./scripts/dev/setup.sh
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Fill in your API keys and configuration
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set

3. **Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Architecture

### Directory Structure
- `app/` - Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `frontend/` - React components and frontend logic
- `backend/` - Firebase configuration and backend logic
- `config/` - Application configuration
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `scripts/` - Development and deployment scripts

### Component Organization
- `sections/` - Page sections (Hero, About, Projects, etc.)
- `layout/` - Layout components (Header, Footer, etc.)
- `ui/` - Reusable UI components

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production branch
- `develop` - Development branch
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `hotfix/*` - Hotfix branches

### Coding Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed

### Testing
```bash
npm run test          # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

### Code Quality
```bash
npm run lint          # Check for linting issues
npm run lint:fix      # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format        # Format code
npm run type-check    # TypeScript type checking
```

## Debugging

### Common Issues
1. **Build Errors**: Check TypeScript types and imports
2. **Runtime Errors**: Check browser console and server logs
3. **API Issues**: Verify environment variables and API keys
4. **Styling Issues**: Check Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS

### Development Tools
- React Developer Tools
- Firebase Debug View
- Chrome DevTools
- VS Code Extensions (ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets)

## Performance Optimization

### Best Practices
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Implement lazy loading for components
- Minimize bundle size with code splitting
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize database queries

### Bundle Analysis
```bash
npm run analyze
```
